<h3>We are fully trained and insured for your peace of mind.</h3>
<p>Your cooker is a major feature in your kitchen and something that we all rely on. Having your oven cleaned professionally not only will it look fantastic but it will also be more effective and last longer.

<p>EcoTech has been covering Pinner and the surrounding villages for over 5 years and a high volume of our work is repeat business and recommendation. We are members of Checkatrade and Which Trusted Traders.</p>
<h3>EcoTech oven cleaning service is completed as follows:</h3>
<ul>
<li> First we remove all the removable parts (racks, trays, linings, back plate and fan blade where possible) which we place in a dip tank in our van and we then heat this up and leave them to soak.</li>
<li> Meanwhile, we take off the doors of the oven, open them up so we can clean inside and between the glass. Remove and clean the rubber seals. With plenty of elbow grease, we remove all burnt on carbon deposits inside the oven leaving it clean and shiny.</li>
<li> Extractor hoods are cleaned inside and out (except motor) papers filters are replaced or permanent metal filters are cleaned.</li>
<li> We also replace light bulbs (if necessary and possible) free of charge.</li>
</ul>

<li> Now we wash the carpets using the powerful hot water (steam) extraction method which applies water to the carpet and simultaneously with the machines’ two powerful vacuums extracts the water and dirt leaving your carpets damp (not wet) – usually dry in 2 to 3 hours and your carpets are left clean, fresh and revived.</li>
<li> As an option (at extra cost) we can apply a stain protector which helps to make the carpets more resistant to stains and spillages and helps to extend the life of your carpet.</li>

<h3 class="uk-text-center">We are fully trained and insured for your peace of mind.</h3>
<p class="uk-text-justify">Your cooker is a major feature in your kitchen and something that we all rely on. Having your oven cleaned professionally not only will it look fantastic but it will also be more effective and last longer and your food will taste better as all the burnt on carbons can affect the taste and smell of your food. Once your grill is cleaned your smoke alarm is a lot less likely to be set off.</p>

<ul class="uk-list uk-article-lead uk-list-space uk-list-line">
<li> First we remove all the removable parts (racks, trays, linings, back plate and fan blade where possible) which we place in a dip tank in our van and we then heat this up and leave them to soak.</li>
<li> Meanwhile, we take off the doors of the oven, open them up so we can clean inside and between the glass. Remove and clean the rubber seals. With plenty of elbow grease, we remove all the burnt on deposits and carbon inside the oven leaving it clean and shiny.</li>
<li> Extractor hoods are cleaned inside and out (except motor) papers filters are replaced or permanent metal filters are cleaned.</li>
<li> We also replace light bulbs (if necessary and possible) free of charge.</li>
